#### Jak 3
Jak 3 is set in the New World, its time frame placing it around 300 years after the events of the first game. Jak 3 largely focuses on the Wasteland, a large desert only briefly referred to in the previous entry in the series as being completely uninhabited and inhospitable.

Spargus City, a large settlement within the Wasteland bordering the ocean, is where the game officially begins, and serves as a hub for the player, where new weapons and upgrades can be earned, and most missions are given out.

#### Jak and Dexter
Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy offers several collectibles for the player to gather. The main objects are "Power Cells", used to energize machinery for use in reaching new levels. Egg-shaped "Precursor Orbs" function as currency, and can be traded in for Power Cells at several locations in the game, while collecting all seven "Scout Flies" in any level rewards the player with a Power Cell. While Precursor Orbs are present in all Jak and Daxter games, Power Cells would not make a reappearance until Jak 3, where they appear in artifact collecting missions.

#### Jak II
The game begins with Jak and Daxter, the protagonists, and Samos, their guardian, watching as Keira, Samos’ daughter and Jak’s love interest, demonstrate the Rift Rider and Precursor Rift Gate that they found in the previous game. When activated, the Rift opens a portal, and a large ominous atmosphere and a monster appear. Jak launches the Rider through the gate, past the monster. Jak and Daxter, separated from Keira and Samos, arrive in the segregated dystopia known as Haven City. They are separated on arrival, and Jak is captured by the city's Krimzon Guard. While Jak is imprisoned, he undergoes experiments with Dark Eco under the command of the city's leader: Baron Praxis. Jak, along with previous prisoners in the city jail, were experimented on for Operation: Dark Warrior, a project that consisted of injecting prisoners with dark eco in order to give them super-human abilities to be used in Haven City's war against animalistic creatures called Metal Heads. Jak, the only prisoner to survive the experiments, is altered mentally and physically, turning him (temporarily under random and controlled spasms) into a deadly monster.

#### Jak X
After saving Haven City once again, Jak and Daxter find themselves poisoned forced into competition on the international car-racing circuit by the execution of Krew's will.

Featuring over a dozen customizable vehicles designed with unique handling characteristics, players will race their whip through 20 tracks in eight different terrain arenas. With an assortment of power-ups available, including projectile weapons, mines, ranged weapons, turbo boosts, shields, and smart bombs, players should have the means necessary to ensure they're the first to cross the finish line.

The game supports both offline and online multiplayer. Offline multiplayer is the typical two-player split-screen multiplayer. Online multiplayer is playable with up to five other players. Both modes feature the same game types, which are the same as the single player except that human players are replacing the AI.

#### Nightfire
The game's prologue mission starts in Paris, France, with James Bond (voiced by Maxwell Caulfield with the likeness of Pierce Brosnan) helping French Intelligence Operative Dominique Paradis evade a gang chase while chasing a truck with a stolen nuclear weapon, before continuing in his car. After stopping the truck from blowing up the Eiffel Tower, Dominique and James celebrate the new year.

#### Juiced
The player can choose a wide variety of car modifications, such as visual modifications, performance modifications and more. All of these customization options provide a personalized and unique car to suit the player’s needs. The gameplay offered to the player includes a career mode, sprint, race, solo, cruise, and a new show-off mode where the player does tricks with his or her car to keep the crowd entertained.

#### Killzone
The game is set in an era of space colonization where the Helghast Empire has recovered from its defeat in the First Helghan War and launched a blitzkrieg against the outer Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (I.S.A.) colony planet Vekta. Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces.
In the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their human cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast and trained troopers, they require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to that found on the planet Helghan.
The player takes control of I.S.A. Captain Jan Templar, who is fighting off the Helghast invasion. Templar and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the I.S.A. operative Gregor Hakha and the information in his possession. During the course of the game, the player also takes control of several other characters, such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Staff Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy.

#### LEGO Indiana Jones
In LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures the players get to explore the Indiana Jones universe with "LEGO-fied" characters. 

The game focuses on the three original films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, each film consisting of six separate chapters retelling the stories in a humorous, light-hearted way that tones down the violence while removing some of the more overt religious and political references found in the film.
